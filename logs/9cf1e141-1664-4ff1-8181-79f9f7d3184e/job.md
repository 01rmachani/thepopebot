This is a second simple test job to further verify thepopebot functionality. Please:

1. Create a new file called `test-output-2.md` in the logs directory for this job
2. Write the current date and time to the file
3. Add a message: "Second test job running successfully!"
4. Check if any other test files exist in the logs directory and list them
5. Create a simple JSON file called `test-data.json` with basic system information (date, working directory, job ID)
6. Confirm the job completed successfully by adding a "SECOND TEST COMPLETE" message at the end

This is another basic functionality test to verify consistent operation of the thepopebot system.
