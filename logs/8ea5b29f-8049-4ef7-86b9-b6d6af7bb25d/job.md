This is a third simple test job to continue verifying thepopebot functionality. Please:

1. Create a new file called `test-output-3.md` in the logs directory for this job
2. Write the current date and time to the file
3. Add a message: "Third test job executing properly!"
4. Search for all existing test files (test-output*.md, test-data*.json) in the logs directory and create a summary
5. Create a CSV file called `test-results.csv` with columns: job_number, timestamp, status
6. Add an entry for this job (job 3) with current timestamp and "completed" status
7. Confirm the job completed successfully by adding a "THIRD TEST COMPLETE" message at the end

This is the third functionality test to verify thepopebot can handle multiple sequential jobs and file operations.
