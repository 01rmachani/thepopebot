This is a simple test job to verify the thepopebot system is working correctly. Please:

1. Create a new file called `test-output.md` in the logs directory for this job
2. Write the current date and time to the file
3. Add a simple "Hello from thepopebot!" message
4. List the contents of the current working directory
5. Confirm the job completed successfully by adding a "TEST COMPLETE" message at the end

This is just a basic functionality test to ensure the Docker agent, Pi coding system, and GitHub integration are all working properly.
