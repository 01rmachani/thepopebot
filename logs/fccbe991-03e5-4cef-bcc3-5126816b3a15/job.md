This is a fourth simple test job to continue verifying thepopebot functionality. Please:

1. Create a new file called `test-output-4.md` in the logs directory for this job
2. Write the current date and time to the file
3. Add a message: "Fourth test job running successfully!"
4. Count how many test files exist in the logs directory from previous jobs
5. Create a simple text file called `job-counter.txt` with the total number of test jobs run so far
6. Add a brief system status check (disk space, memory if available)
7. Confirm the job completed successfully by adding a "FOURTH TEST COMPLETE" message at the end

This is another basic functionality test to verify continued operation of the thepopebot system.
