Create a comprehensive API design plan for a minimal online cab booking service. The plan should include:

1. **Core Endpoints Analysis**:
   - Identify the absolute minimum endpoints required for a functional cab booking service
   - Define clear user flows (passenger and driver perspectives)
   - Specify authentication and authorization requirements

2. **API Specification**:
   - Design RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
   - Define request/response schemas for each endpoint
   - Include error handling and status codes
   - Specify required vs optional parameters

3. **Essential Features Coverage**:
   - User registration and authentication
   - Ride booking and matching
   - Real-time location tracking
   - Payment processing integration points
   - Basic ride history

4. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Rate limiting strategies
   - Data validation requirements
   - Security best practices
   - Scalability considerations for core endpoints

5. **Documentation Deliverable**:
   - Create a markdown file with the complete API specification
   - Include example requests/responses
   - Provide implementation notes and best practices
   - Save the plan to `docs/cab-booking-api-plan.md`

Focus on simplicity and core functionality rather than advanced features. The goal is a production-ready minimal viable API that covers the essential cab booking workflow.
